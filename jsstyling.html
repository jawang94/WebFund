                <h1>JavaScript Basics</h1>
                <p>Javascript is a cross-platform, object-oriented scripting language. JavaScript is extremely popular for a
                    variety of reasons. It is a small and lightweight language allowing maximum flexibility for developers to
                    take it in a bunch of different directions. JavaScript lives inside a host environment (a web browser or
                    Node server), it can be connected to the objects of these environments to provide programmatic control over
                    them.
                </p>
                </div>           
                <ul id="bodylist">
                    <li class="bodycontent">
                        <h6>Variable Declaration</h6>
                        <p>
                            JavaScript variables a re containers for storing data values - imagine a cup you fill with coffee,
                            the cup holdst he coffee, a variable holds a value. All JavaSCript variables must be identified with
                            unique names. These unique names are called identifiers. var x;
                        </p>
                    </li>
                    <li class="bodycontent">
                        <h6>Variable Assignment</h6>
                        <p>
                            Assignment operators assign values to JavaScript variables - our cup can now have coffee poured in
                            it, giving our variable a value to hold. The = assignment operator assigns a value to a variable.
                            var x = 10;
                        </p>
                    </li>
                    <li class="bodycontent">
                        <h6>Data Types</h6>
                        <p>
                            Data types are an important concept; to be able to operate on variables you need to know the data
                            type. There are six data types that are JavaScript primitives: Boolean - true or false; null - null
                            aka nothing; Number - 42 or 3.14159; String - "Coding Dojo Rocks!; Array - [1,'Coding',2,'Dojo];
                            and Object - {first_name:'Jane,last_name:'Doe}
                        </p>
                    </li>
                    <li class="bodycontent">
                        <h6>Conditionals</h6>
                        <p>When you write code, you want to perform different actions for different decisions- hitting different
                            code blocks based on values or conditions that have been met. You can use conditional statements
                            in your code to accomplish this. There are the following conditional statements: if a specified condition
                            is true, do this code in our code block; else if is to specify a new condition to test, if the first
                            condition is false; else we execute this block of code; </p>
                    </li>
                    <li class="bodycontent">
                        <h6>Loops</h6>
                        <p>
                            There are many different kinds of loops in every programming language, but they all essentially do
                            the same thing: they will repeat an action some number of times. Imagine you have to run a mile,well
                            you run around the track four times and then you stop. That's a loop!
                        </p>
                    </li>
                    <li class="bodycontent">
                        <h6>Function</h6>
                        <p>
                            Functions are an encaspulation of a code block. When we call our function this will run that code
                            block. Think of it as a list of instructions. As an example imagine we are putting together a desk
                            from Ikea, we open up the instruction manual and get started, first we screw the legs to the table
                            top; next we place the table the right way up. Done! We finished our instructions. Sadly there are
                            a ton more tables to do so lets call our functions over and over and over again.
                        </p>
